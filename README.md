# Developing an AI Application
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into several applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

In this project, an image classifier is trained to recognize different species of flowers. The idea in this project can be deployed as a phone app that can use the phone's camera to identify the specie of a flower. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.
